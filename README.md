## Overview

The Smart Color Mixer project allows users to control an RGB LED using a smartphone with the MQTT Dash app. It features various color modes, a startup sequence, and IoT integration for remote control and cloud logging.

## Features

- Five color modes: yellow, magenta, white, sequential animation, and all LEDs off.
- Distinctive startup sequence with a three-second beep.
- IoT integration using ESP32 for remote control and monitoring.
- Cloud logging of RGB LED color data on ThingSpeak.
- Modular design for future enhancements.

## Components

- Arduino UNO
- ESP32 Development Board
- Buzzer Module
- RGB LED Module
- Breadboard
- Various Jumper Wires
- 100-ohm Resistor
